# Project description

The project is a web application for saving, displaying and ordering bookmarks. Users can group the bookmarks by themes, share or maintain them private. 

The application supports internationalisation. 

Each user can create an account, log into the application and enjoy its perks! 

The application runs on a GlassFish Payara Server and saves its data in a PostregreSQL database.
